# The Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns
The Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns implemented in C# (real world examples)

> Design patterns are solutions to software design problems you find again and again in real-world application development.
> Patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of objects.
> The 23 Gang of Four (GoF) patterns are generally considered the foundation for all other patterns.
> They are categorized in three groups: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.


### Creational Patterns
-  ABSTRACT FACOTRY     `Creates an instance of several families of classes` :heavy_check_mark:
-  BUILDER	            `Separates object construction from its representation` :heavy_check_mark:
-  FACTORY   	          `Creates an instance of several derived classes` :heavy_check_mark:
-  PROTOTYPE	          `A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned` :hourglass_flowing_sand:
-  SINGLETON        	  `A class of which only a single instance can exist` :heavy_check_mark:

### Structural Patterns
-  ADAPTER	    `Match interfaces of different classes` :hourglass_flowing_sand:
-  BRIDGE	      `Separates an object’s interface from its implementation` :hourglass_flowing_sand:
-  COMPOSITE	  `A tree structure of simple and composite objects` :hourglass_flowing_sand:
-  DECORATOR	  `Add responsibilities to objects dynamically` :hourglass_flowing_sand:
-  FACADE	      `A single class that represents an entire subsystem` :heavy_check_mark:
-  FLYWEIGHT	  `A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing` :heavy_check_mark:
-  PROXY	      `An object representing another object` :hourglass_flowing_sand:

### Behavioral Patterns
-  CHAIN OF RESP.	  `A way of passing a request between a chain of objects` :hourglass_flowing_sand:
-  COMMAND	        `Encapsulate a command request as an object` :heavy_check_mark:
-  INTERPRETER	    `A way to include language elements in a program` :hourglass_flowing_sand:
-  INTERATOR	      `Sequentially access the elements of a collection` :heavy_check_mark:
-  MEDIATOR	        `Defines simplified communication between classes` :hourglass_flowing_sand:
-  MEMENTO	        `Capture and restore an object's internal state` :hourglass_flowing_sand:
-  OBSERVER	        `A way of notifying change to a number of classes` :heavy_check_mark:
-  STATE	          `Alter an object's behavior when its state changes` :heavy_check_mark:
-  STRATEGY	        `Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class` :heavy_check_mark:
-  TEMPLATE         `Method	Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass` :heavy_check_mark:
-  VISITOR	        `Defines a new operation to a class without change` :hourglass_flowing_sand:
